Medoly is based on several better games.

== The Map

Medoly uses a hexagonal grid with a radius of 99 hexes.
Almost all the edge hexes wrap.

=== Directions
Medoly uses "W," "E," "D," "X," "Z," and "A" for directions.
"W" moves north-west, "E" moves north-east, "D" moves east, "X" moves south-east, "Z" moves south-west, and "A" moves west.

The easiest way to remember this (that is if you have a QWERTY keyboard) is that the letters surround the "S" key and correspond to one of the hex sides.
